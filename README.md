# Deep Learning A-Z

Welcome to the **Deep Learning A-Z** repository! This collection is designed to guide you through the foundational concepts and implementations of various deep learning architectures, providing hands-on experience with each model type.

## 📚 Repository Overview

This repository is structured into six main sections, each focusing on a different deep learning architecture:

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** : Explore the basics of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and training processes.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** : Delve into models primarily used for image recognition and processing, understanding convolutional layers, pooling, and feature extraction.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** : Learn about networks designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language, and grasp concepts like looping mechanisms and memory retention.
4. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** : Study unsupervised learning techniques that visualize and interpret complex data patterns through dimensionality reduction.
5. **Boltzmann Machines (BM)** : Investigate stochastic recurrent neural networks capable of learning complex probability distributions over datasets.
6. **AutoEncoders (AE)** : Understand models used for data compression and noise reduction by learning efficient codings of input data.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To effectively utilize this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** :

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dash7ou/deep-learning.git
   cd deep-learning
   ```

```

1. **Set Up the Environment** :

* It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
* Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  ```
* Alternatively, if you use `conda`, create an environment using the `environment.yml` file:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate deep-learning
  ```

  ```

1. **Explore the Notebooks** :

* Each section contains Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations and code implementations.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  ```
* Navigate to the desired section and open the notebook to begin your learning journey.
